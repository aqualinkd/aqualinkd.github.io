SSID='YOUR_SSID'
PASSWORD='YOUR_PASSWORD'

# --- Wi-Fi Configuration ---
# 1. Surround SSID and PASSWORD with single quotes (' ') by default.
# 2. Use double quotes (" ") ONLY if your password contains a single quote (').
# 3. If your password has BOTH ' and ", use double quotes (" ") and put a backslash (\) before any " or $ or \.

# Examples:
# SSID='Guest WiFi'
# PASSWORD='pa$$word123'           # Result: pa$$word123        (Standard)
# PASSWORD="It'sAPassword"         # Result: It'sAPassword      (Has single quote)
# PASSWORD="It's \"Money\" \$100"  # Result: It's "Money" $100  (Has both)
